# 🚀 From Cloud to Code: My AltSchool Journey Begins

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to my digital playground! This repository contains my first semester project at AltSchool Africa, where I am studying Cloud Engineering. The project is a four-page website showcasing my skills in front-end development, which is part of our training.

## 🎨 The Canvas

Four web pages, each a piece of the puzzle:
1. **Home Page**: A professional background description highlighting my skills, experiences, and aspirations in cloud engineering.
2. **Application Page**: Modeled after the AltSchool application page, demonstrating my ability to recreate real-world web interfaces.
3. **Courses Page**: A learning roadmap, AltSchool style
5. **Media Page**: Where my personalities collide - in pictures, tunes, and videos, illustrating my ability to embed and organize multimedia content.


## 🛠️ The Tools

- HTML5: The bones
- CSS3: The looks
- JavaScript: The brains

## 💡 The Spark

This project is not just about code—it is about transformation. From cloud novice to front-end explorer, watch this space evolve as I soar through AltSchool's program. It represents my progress in front-end development during the first semester at AltSchool Africa. While my main focus is Cloud Engineering, these front-end skills provide a crucial foundation for implementing web technologies and user interface design.
